### To do

- delay vod deletion on stream end so clients have time to fetch latest chunks?
- cap frames to 30 on 360p & 480p resolution
- swap fs.watch with chokidar
- upgrade to fluent-ffmpeg?
- build frontend
- add Bilinear Image Scaling
- add audio&video ready event
- add fallbacks for thumbs creation if source lower then 480p
